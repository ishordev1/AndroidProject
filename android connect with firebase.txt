Basic of FireBase first create 
-> Project    
 one project has multiple application. like FB, insta, twitter, etc
          -> Apps 1
          -> Apps 2 etc



One project has only one Database. 
That database stores all app data in a single table;
          



So Dont confuse




Two way to configure the firebase.
 i. configure with android studio
 ii. configure with json file.

I. 

first login in firebase
open tool-> click firebase-> realtime database -> first connect -> in browser select the project .
Automatic added the google-service.json file in the project.


also add SDK in your project -> same path -> tool-> firebase->realtimedatabase-> sdk->click on that
accept


if not show google-service.json don't worry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. 
Once you remove that google-service.json from the project then it will disconnect. and again to connect

open tool-> click firebase-> realtime database -> first connect (signup).
create project-> add dependency -> click accept dependency button it will auto added dependency or you can go with manual process.
in the setting, there are all options.
 download the google-service.json file-> past in app folder in the project.

sync Now..
or


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
make sure in your reatime database in firebase has read write permission.
how give read write permission in firebase-----> go in realtime database ---> Rules --> make read, write true in json
ex:
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
------------------------------------------------

after all setup do you operation if any problem come check Logcat filter: FirebaseData
